# Go CHIP-8

This is (yet another) CHIP-8 emulator written in Go. Yes there are many others but this one is mine.

What is CHIP-8? It's a simple 8-bit virtual machine developed in the 1970s, which found new life in the 90s on HP graphing calculators. It's become the defacto "hello world" for emulator developers to get started with.

Goals:

- Write my first emulator
- Learn about virtual machine development (no, I mean _real_ [virtual machines](https://wiki.c2.com/?VirtualMachine), not that ugly IaaS stuff)
- Have fun

Use cases & key features:

- WASM support, playable in browser as well as Linux and Windows binaries
- Other stuff?
- Joypad support?

Supporting technologies and libraries:

- [Ebiten](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten)
